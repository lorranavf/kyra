    ATLAS is a reproducible and scalable RNA-Seq analysis workflow for plants, automating processes from raw data acquisition (via portals like JGI and SRA) to transcript quantification using Salmon with decoy sequences to filter spurious alignments and enhance precision. Built on Nextflow and asynchronously managed by Celery with Redis, the pipeline integrates critical steps such as adaptive quality control (Trimmomatic), transcriptome indexing, and consolidated reporting (MultiQC), all within Docker-containerized environments. Its decoupled architecture enables API-driven execution, connecting directly to the platformâ€™s database to store results like expression profiles, essential for constructing co-expression networks. Focused on agricultural species, ATLAS forms the foundation for downstream analyses on the platform, combining technical reproducibility with scalability for large-scale transcriptomic studies. Currently in its early implementation phase, the project represents a milestone in standardizing RNA-Seq analyses for plant research.
